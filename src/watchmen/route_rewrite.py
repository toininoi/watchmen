"""Per-harness file emitters for ``watchmen route`` recommendations.

When ``route`` lands a ``downshift`` / ``upshift`` / ``switch-harness``
decision, we don't stop at "you should swap" — we write the actual files
the harness reads at runtime, so the user runs `watchmen route` once and
their main agent natively delegates the skill to the recommended model.

Each harness has a different model-bearing artifact format and a
different dispatch syntax the SKILL.md body has to invoke.  The mapping
came out of the harness research pass:

  claude_code  ➜  ``<repo>/.claude/agents/<bucket>-router.md`` (YAML
                  frontmatter ``model:`` + system-prompt body).  Dispatch
                  via ``Task subagent_type=<bucket>-router``.

  codex        ➜  ``~/.codex/route-<bucket>.config.toml`` (TOML
                  ``model = "..."``).  Dispatch via
                  ``codex exec --profile-v2 route-<bucket>``.

  opencode     ➜  ``<repo>/.opencode/agents/<bucket>-router.md`` (YAML
                  frontmatter ``mode: subagent`` + ``model:``).  Dispatch
                  via ``@<bucket>-router`` mention.

  pi           ➜  ``~/.pi/agent/agents/<bucket>.md`` (YAML frontmatter
                  ``model:``).  Requires the opt-in subagent extension at
                  ``~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/``; without it, route
                  falls back to a body-only "run ``pi --model X``"
                  recommendation.

The SKILL.md body rewrite happens once per skill (not once per harness):
we insert a single ``<!-- watchmen-route:dispatch -->`` block that lists
each affected harness's dispatch sentence.  Future ``watchmen curate``
runs preserve this block via marker matching.
