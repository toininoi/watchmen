"""4-stage skill + CLAUDE.md curator with critic sub-agent.

Stages:
  1. candidate-finder  : reads thesis + scans source repo, outputs filtered list of procedural
                         skill candidates that have actual code behind them.
  2. per-skill curator : one multi-turn agent per candidate. Investigates → drafts SKILL.md +
                         scripts → spawns critic → refines → commits.
  3. claude.md author  : reads finalized skills + thesis sections, drafts CLAUDE.md, runs through
                         critic, refines.
  4. index writer      : writes _index.md summarizing what was generated and why.

Output: bundles/<project_key>/ with skills/<name>/, CLAUDE.md, _curation_log.md, _index.md.

Usage:
  uv run curate.py --project tally-weijl-images --repo ~/Development/personal/tally-weijl-images

    You are identifying real, packageable skill candidates for a coding-agent workspace.

    {harness_block}

    A real skill candidate must satisfy ALL of these:
      - It is a RECURRING procedure. The pattern must recur — either as repeated
        steps within a single session OR across multiple sessions. A one-off
        execution is not enough.
      - It has actual artifacts (Python scripts, bash commands, structured prompts, file templates) that
        already exist in the source repo or in session transcripts.
      - It can be triggered by a specific kind of user request — you can describe the trigger.
      - Generalizing it (turning hardcoded paths/keys into args) preserves its usefulness.

    Reject candidates that are:
      - Behavioral observations only ("task-direct", "low-ceremony communication", "thanks mate") —
        these are about the user, not skills.
      - One-time exploratory work that didn't repeat. If you cannot point at the
        recurrence (within a session or across sessions), drop it.
      - Stuff that's already a one-line bash command with no procedure around it.
      - About OTHER repos, personal side projects, or non-coding workflows (e.g. investment
        analysis, stock trading, customer projects rooted in other directories), even if the
        thesis mentions them — they would not belong checked into THIS repo's skills/ directory.
        The test: would the artifacts live naturally inside the source repo you're scanning?

    Harness overlap — IMPORTANT when the list above is non-empty:
      - If a candidate substantially overlaps with one of the user's installed
        skills (same job, same trigger phrasing), prefer proposing it as an
        ENHANCEMENT of the existing skill rather than a brand-new bundle.
        Set the `enhancement_of` field on the candidate to the existing slug.
        Frame the description as "add X to <slug>" or "fill in missing Y in <slug>".
      - If a candidate is genuinely the same skill (no enhancement to offer), drop it.
        Don't ship duplicates — the user already has it.
      - If a candidate composes two installed skills run in sequence
        (e.g. the user runs `craft-plan` then `implement`), propose a composed
        skill that REFERENCES the existing slugs in its body rather than
        re-implementing their procedure. Still set `enhancement_of` to the more
        primary of the two slugs.

    Process:
      1. Read the thesis sections "Skill candidates" and "Workflow archetypes" via read_thesis_section.
      2. For each plausible candidate, use list_repo_files + read_repo_file to verify the artifacts exist.
      3. Pick session_ids that demonstrate the trigger pattern via query_corpus or by reading the thesis's
         "Notable sessions" section.
      4. Cross-reference against the user's harness list above. Decide for each:
         genuinely new / enhancement of existing / duplicate-drop.
      5. When you have your filtered list, call finish_candidates with a JSON-like structured output.

    Be ruthless. Better to ship 3 strong, distinct candidates than 10 weak or
    overlapping ones. The user's harness will get cluttered if you over-propose.

    Your job: produce a complete, runnable skill bundle under skills/{skill_slug}/ containing:
      - SKILL.md  — frontmatter (name, description, when-to-use), then instructions for the future agent
      - scripts/  — actual Python/bash files. Extract real code from the source repo (read_repo_file),
                    generalize hardcoded values into args. Don't reinvent.
      - references/ — optional. Extracted notes (API quirks, schemas) that the skill will load on demand.

    SKILL.md frontmatter format:
      ---
      name: {skill_slug}

         Focus on EXTRACTING real code, not reinventing.
      2. Draft the bundle — write SKILL.md and at least one script via write_bundle_file.
         Use paths like 'skills/{skill_slug}/SKILL.md', 'skills/{skill_slug}/scripts/<name>.py'.
      3. When draft is in place, call run_critic with skill_dir='skills/{skill_slug}' and a representative
         sample_task. The critic will report missing/ambiguous/hardcoded/broken issues.
      4. Refine based on critic feedback. Re-read with read_bundle_file, rewrite as needed.
      5. Loop until the critic says it's clean OR you've done 2 critic rounds.

    You are a critic evaluating a coding-agent skill bundle. The bundle lives at: {skill_dir}

    Your job: Read every file in the skill bundle. Then evaluate as if you were a future agent receiving
    that sample task. Could you execute the skill end-to-end? Where would you fail?

    Specifically check:
      - Trigger description: would a future agent know when to use this from a user prompt?
      - Anti-triggers: is `when_not_to_use` present and specific? Would a borderline prompt
        (adjacent task shape, similar vocabulary) be correctly REJECTED based on what's written?
        Generic exclusions ("not for unrelated tasks") don't count — flag them as ambiguous.
      - Procedure steps: are they unambiguous? Any "do the thing" hand-waving?
      - Scripts: hardcoded paths, API keys, or values that should be args/env vars?
      - Imports / dependencies: are they declared somewhere?
      - Inputs/Outputs: clear about what the skill consumes and where it writes?

    A good CLAUDE.md is a STANDING BRIEF for any future coding-agent session opened in this repo. It
    answers EVERY question a fresh agent might have on day 1: what this project is, how it's structured,
    how to build/test/run it, what conventions exist, what skills are available, what should I know
    before doing anything, what landmines exist, how the user communicates.

    Your job: capture as much actionable, observable signal as possible — combining BEHAVIORAL signal
    from the thesis with STRUCTURAL signal from the source repo (code organization, build tooling,
    env contracts, conventions).

    Use ALL of these sections. Skip a section ONLY if there is genuinely no signal for it.

      # {project_key} — workspace context

      ## What this project is
      <2-3 sentences: what it does, who it's for, key tech stack (frameworks, languages, infra)>

      ## Code structure
      <key directories and what lives where; conventions like "lib/api/ is generated, never hand-edit";
      derive from list_repo_files + read_repo_file on package.json / pyproject.toml / Cargo.toml / etc.>

      ## Development environment
      <env vars required, dev server quirks, ports/proxies, key dependencies, OS-specific gotchas>

      ## Common commands
      <build / lint / test / dev / deploy — the actual npm / cargo / uv / pnpm scripts the user runs;
      derive from package.json scripts or thesis "Notable sessions">

      ## Coding patterns & conventions
      <state management lib, data fetching, file naming, component patterns, type policies, formatting;
      derive from repo files + session evidence>

      ## Test strategy
      <what tests exist or don't; framework; where they live; what the user does for verification
      (e.g. "no automated tests yet — minimum check is npm run lint")>

      ## Active workflows
      <bulleted list — reference the SKILLS that handle each. e.g. "- Bulk image generation → see skills/fal-bulk-generation/">

      ## Available skills
      <table: skill name | location | activation hint phrases>

      ## Recurring patterns
      <workflow archetypes from thesis NOT covered by a discrete skill — cost-conscious sampling,
      audit-before-expensive, drop-path-and-go, etc.>

      ## Coding rules (do's and don'ts)
      <derived from session corrections: where the user said "no, don't do that" or "always do X".
      Cite session_id when possible. Examples: "Don't describe wash/color in prompts that have a
      product reference", "Don't run npm run build for verification">

      ## Known landmines
      <pitfalls observed across sessions: error patterns, content-policy issues, env-override priority
      bugs, sub-agent auth failures, etc. Each bullet should be a *specific* trap with *how to avoid* it>

      ## Debugging playbook
      <when something breaks, what does the user actually do? Each entry: symptom → diagnostic procedure
      (the specific logs, queries, or commands the user reached for) → likely root causes, cited by
      session_id. This is the *recovery* counterpart to landmines: landmines say "don't step here",
      this section says "if you did step there, here's how to find out and fix it". Mine sessions with
      high tool_error_count or visible frustration for the actual diagnostic moves used.>

      ## Communication style notes
      <how the user talks to the agent — tone, expectations, what to mirror; e.g. enthusiasm welcome,
      task-direct compressed handoffs, fast self-correction without friction>

    Process:
      1. read_thesis_section for: 'Workflow archetypes', 'Notable sessions', 'Communication style',
         'Drift', 'Frustration / pushback patterns', 'Skill candidates'. The 'Frustration / pushback
         patterns' section is especially important for the Debugging playbook — it points to sessions
         where the user hit errors and recovered. Use query_corpus with filters like
         `SELECT session_id, tool_error_count FROM sessions WHERE tool_error_count > 3 ORDER BY
         tool_error_count DESC LIMIT 10` to find high-friction sessions, then read_session_full to
         extract the actual diagnostic moves (which commands/queries the user ran to localize the bug).
      2. list_repo_files (broad pattern like '*' or '**/*') to map the repo's structure.
      3. read_repo_file on key infrastructure files: package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml,
         README.md, .env.example, tsconfig.json — whichever apply.
      4. list_bundle_files(subdir='skills') and read each SKILL.md frontmatter.
      5. Draft and write CLAUDE.md via write_bundle_file.
      6. run_critic with skill_dir='' (review whole CLAUDE.md), sample_task='a fresh agent opens this repo'.
      7. Refine if critic flags issues.
      8. append_curation_log + call finish_claude_md.

    Prefer concrete observation over generic prose. "uses Zustand for auth state, React Query for
    data fetching" beats "uses modern state management". Cite session_ids for behavioral claims.
