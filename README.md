---

Reusable skills and workspace briefs, built from what you actually do, carried
across Claude Code, Codex, and pi.dev. You install it once and never change how
you work.

The manual fix is writing a `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` by hand, but that's you
doing the learning on behalf of the agent. That's backwards.

watchmen sits behind **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **pi.dev**. It silently
watches your sessions, mines what you actually do, and writes skill bundles +
workspace briefs (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`) so your next session is smarter
than your last. Same skills follow you across agents — switch between Claude
Code and Codex on the same repo and they pick up where the other left off.

## Why it matters

- **Fewer tokens burned re-explaining yourself.** Your agent stops
  rediscovering the same procedures every session. The skill is already on
  disk, so context that used to be spent re-deriving it isn't.
- **Fewer tool errors per session.** watchmen's own impact card tracks median
  tool errors before and after a project's skills land, on a 16-week curve.
- **Unified context layer across every agent.** Switch from Claude Code to
  Codex in the middle of development and the skills you need will follow. No
  need to re-onboard the new agent.

**Local storage, cross-agent, continuous.**

watchmen stores transcripts, metrics, analyses, and generated bundles on your
machine. Analysis runs send selected session excerpts to your chosen LLM
provider (OpenRouter, OpenAI, or Anthropic) using your own API key; nothing
is uploaded outside those explicit LLM calls.

## What watchmen actually does

While you work, it:

- 🤖 **Captures sessions from every agent** — Claude Code (`~/.claude/projects/`), Codex (`~/.codex/sessions/`), pi.dev. One corpus across tools.
- 📚 **Auto-curates skills** — recurring procedures get turned into runnable skill bundles your agent can call: `SKILL.md` + scripts + references.
- ✍️ **Auto-writes CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md** — workspace brief, identical content for both, refreshed continuously.
- 📈 **Surfaces what's working** — mission control web UI, per-project impact tracking, friction signals, action queue.
- 💡 **Retrospective skill hints** — when you could've used an existing skill, the next statusLine update tells you. Never modifies your agent's context. Never blocks you.

You install it. It runs. Your agents get better every day you use them.

## The CLI

```
watchmen init
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/cli-banner.png" alt="watchmen onboarding banner" width="100%">
</p>

Six steps. Most run in seconds; the LLM passes (analyze + curate) are the only slow ones — you see the cost estimate before they run. Stop at any confirmation gate; nothing partial is left behind.

## Mission control

A local web dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8979` — no hosted account or remote
dashboard. Top-of-page tells you:

- **Skill calls this week vs last week** — are your curated skills being invoked?
- **Tool errors per session** — is friction going up or down?
- **Active repos** — what's getting work this week?
- **Skill leaderboard** — which repo's skills are firing most
- **Status tiles** — traffic-light health per project (healthy / stale / uncurated)
- **Next actions** — ranked queue, e.g. "kai-bench has 28 prompts to analyze · Run"

### Per-project impact

Drill into any tracked repo and you get a **before/after** view scoped to that project. 16-week chart of tool errors per session with a dashed annotation at the date the curator first landed. Pre/post comparison table: sessions, median tool errors, median prompts, median cost. Honest empty states when there isn't enough post-treatment data yet — never silently disappears.

Subtitle reads "Correlation only — not a controlled experiment." We don't oversell the signal.

### Three themes

Light comic-pulp newsprint by default. **Doomsday** noir mode for the dark-mode crowd. **Rorschach** sepia-typewriter for diary-mode fans. Switch instantly at `/settings` — picker persists per browser via `localStorage`, no reload.

> Dashboard + impact-card screenshots ship with v0.6 — generated against a mock corpus so no real project data leaks into the docs.

## Install

Three commands and a wizard. Total wall time ~10 min + 30–90 min per project of LLM passes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firstbatchxyz/watchmen.git
cd watchmen
uv sync && uv tool install --editable .
watchmen init
```

The wizard handles everything: asks which LLM provider you'd like to use (OpenRouter / OpenAI / Anthropic), prompts for that provider's API key (saves to `~/.config/watchmen/.env`, chmod 600), ingests your `~/.claude/projects/` history, lets you pick which projects to analyze, previews the cost, runs analyze + curate with live progress, installs the daemon + viewer into the host's scheduler (launchd / systemd --user / Task Scheduler) for autostart, and shows you the exact `/plugin` commands to paste inside Claude Code.

Runtime data lives under `~/.watchmen/` (`state.db`, `corpus.db`, `analyses/`, `bundles/`, event logs). Set `WATCHMEN_HOME=/path/to/dir` for an alternate location.

`watchmen doctor` does a one-screen ✓/✗ check across API key, corpus, daemon, viewer, and hooks if anything looks off.

### Plugins

After `watchmen init`, install the plugins inside each agent. **Claude Code:**

```
/plugin marketplace add firstbatchxyz/watchmen
/plugin install watchmen@watchmen
/reload-plugins
```

Then wire the statusLine (one-time):

```bash
watchmen statusline install
```

**Codex:**

```
/plugins marketplace add github:firstbatchxyz/watchmen
/plugins install watchmen
```

You then get `/skills brief` (or `$brief`) inside Codex with the same workspace digest behavior as `/watchmen:brief` in Claude Code. Codex has no statusline, so the live skill-suggestion hint is on-demand `brief` instead.

## Requirements

- macOS, Linux, or Windows 10/11
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Python toolchain) — Python 3.11+
- A credential for **one** of the providers below
- At least one supported coding agent in active use

Default model per provider: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` (OpenRouter) ·
`gpt-5-mini` (OpenAI) · `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (Anthropic). Configurable
per command via `--model`, globally via `WATCHMEN_DEFAULT_MODEL`.

### Provider auth

Pick whichever account you already pay for — `watchmen init` walks you through
it on first run. Switch anytime without losing other credentials:

```bash
watchmen settings provider                            # status: active provider + per-provider credential state
watchmen settings provider claude-pro                 # switch active provider (incl. OAuth ones)
watchmen settings api-key --provider anthropic        # set an API key (live-validated against the provider's API)
```

**API-key providers** — paste a key once, lives in `~/.config/watchmen/.env`
(chmod 0600):

| Provider | Where to get a key | Default model |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenRouter** | [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) — one key, many models, cheapest curator runs | `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` |
| **OpenAI** | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) — billed per-token against your org | `gpt-5-mini` |
| **Anthropic** | [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) — billed per-token against your org | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |

**OAuth providers (macOS, subscription-quota)** — no paste step. If you're
already signed in via the upstream CLI, watchmen reuses that credential
directly and bills against your existing subscription instead of your API
credit:

| Provider | How | Default model |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Pro / Team / Max** (`claude-pro`) | Sign in to Claude Code (`claude` CLI). watchmen reads the OAuth token from the macOS keychain. **Billed against your Claude subscription quota.** | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| **ChatGPT** (`chatgpt`, experimental) | Sign in to Codex (`codex login`) with your ChatGPT account. watchmen reads the OAuth token from `~/.codex/auth.json` and calls the Codex Responses API. Restricted model whitelist. | `gpt-5.4-mini` |

OAuth on Linux / Windows isn't yet supported (Claude Code stores
credentials differently outside macOS); the OAuth providers don't appear
in the picker there.

Codex api-key bonus: if you've previously run `codex login --api-key
sk-...`, the `openai` provider falls back to reusing that key — you don't
need to paste it into watchmen separately.

`WATCHMEN_PROVIDER` controls which provider is active. Shell env wins
over the on-disk file, so CI runs that set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...`
inline still just work.

Three lanes by latency budget:

| Lane | Latency | Triggers | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blocking real-time | <200ms | Hooks: SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit | Reserved for future context injection (no LLM allowed) |
| Async real-time | seconds | Hooks: PostToolUse, Stop | Logging only |
| Batch | minutes-hours | Daemon schedule | Analyst + curator (LLM-heavy) |

## What lands on disk

For each tracked repo:

```
bundles/<repo>/
  CLAUDE.md                # workspace brief auto-generated from session evidence
  AGENTS.md                # identical mirror for Codex
  skills/
    <skill-name>/
      SKILL.md             # frontmatter + trigger phrases + procedure + examples
      scripts/             # actual runnable Python/bash extracted from your repo
      references/          # supporting docs
  _curation_log.md         # agent's decisions + critic feedback
  _candidates.json         # which skills were considered, which got built
  _index.md                # summary of generated artifacts

analyses/<repo>/
  2026-04-09.md            # day-by-day thesis snapshots
  2026-04-10.md            # each refines the running thesis with that day's sessions
  ...
  _running.md              # latest aggregated thesis
```

Both are gitignored — they're your data, not the source.

## Continuous mode

Once installed via `watchmen init` (or by hand):

```bash
watchmen daemon install                      # autostart on login
watchmen viewer install                      # autostart the viewer at :8979
watchmen launchd status                      # verify (also reports systemd --user / Task Scheduler state)
```

Same CLI on every platform; under the hood it installs a launchd agent on macOS, a systemd `--user` unit on Linux, or a Task Scheduler task on Windows. On Linux, run `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER` once if you want the daemon to outlive your login session.

Default cadence:

| What | When |
|---|---|
| Re-ingest all coding-agent transcripts + incremental analyst | Every **2 hours** |
| `CLAUDE.md` regen (light) | After an analyst run if last regen >24h ago |
| **Full curator** (skill bundles + CLAUDE.md, expensive) | **02:00 and 14:00 local**, min 8h between runs per project |

## Steering the curator

Autonomous by default. When you want override:

- **`watchmen pin <project> <skill>`** — hand-edited a SKILL.md and want it preserved. Curator treats pinned skills as forced cache hits.
- **`watchmen drop <project> <skill>`** — keeps proposing a skill you don't want. Drop removes the bundle AND adds the slug to `_blocklist.json`. Stays gone.
- **`watchmen unpin` / `watchmen restore`** — reverse either decision.
- **`watchmen review <project>`** — interactive walk over every skill: keep / drop / pin / skip / view / quit. Audit trail at `bundles/<project>/review.md`.

State lives in `bundles/<project>/_pinned.json` and `_blocklist.json`. Git-tracked, so pin/drop state syncs across machines if you sync the bundle.

### Logs

```
# macOS (launchd)
~/Library/Logs/watchmen.log                          # primary daemon log
~/Library/Logs/watchmen.daemon.{out,err}.log         # launchd stdout/stderr
~/Library/Logs/watchmen.viewer.{out,err}.log         # viewer logs

# Linux (systemd --user)
~/.watchmen/logs/daemon.{out,err}.log                # systemd stdout/stderr
~/.watchmen/logs/viewer.{out,err}.log                # viewer logs
# also: `journalctl --user -u watchmen-daemon.service`

# Windows (Task Scheduler)
%LOCALAPPDATA%\watchmen\logs\watchmen.log            # primary daemon log
%LOCALAPPDATA%\watchmen\logs\daemon.{out,err}.log    # scheduler stdout/stderr
%LOCALAPPDATA%\watchmen\logs\viewer.{out,err}.log    # viewer logs
```

### Approval mode

```bash
watchmen settings set my-project approval_required true
```

New bundles route to `bundles/<project>/_pending/<slug>/` instead of `skills/<slug>/`. Already-approved skills keep updating in place — only first-time additions are gated. `watchmen review` walks `_pending/` first.

### Harness awareness

The candidate finder reads `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` and prefers proposing an **enhancement** of an existing skill when the trigger overlaps. Each candidate may carry `enhancement_of: <slug>` — when set, Stage 2 prepends an ENHANCEMENT MODE preamble so the new bundle is framed as a delta. To drop overlapping candidates entirely instead:

```bash
watchmen curate kai-frontend --skip-overlap
# or persistently:
watchmen settings set kai-frontend skip_overlapping_skills true
```

### Skill distillation

```bash
watchmen distill my-project
watchmen distill my-project --animate
watchmen distill my-project --scope skill-md
watchmen distill my-project --scope folder
watchmen distill my-project --local
watchmen distill my-project --stage
```

`distill` is the non-destructive reducer pass. It inspects the skills already
created for a project, runs pairwise LLM comparisons with a structured
similarity rubric, and writes `bundles/<project>/_distill_plan.json`.
By default it compares low-noise skill metadata: slug, name, description,
`when_to_use`/`trigger_phrases`, and `when_not_to_use`. Use
`--scope skill-md` to also include `SKILL.md` headings and bullets, or
`--scope folder` to add a conservative digest of extra docs/scripts in the skill
folder. The rubric scores semantic replaceability, trigger/procedure overlap,
boundary compatibility, merge risk, and what a merged draft must preserve. Use
`--threshold` to tune the minimum semantic merge score, `--model` or
`WATCHMEN_DISTILL_MODEL` to override the high-consistency distill model, or
`--local` when you only want the offline candidate mesh. In an interactive
terminal, semantic distill asks whether to open the merge picker after analysis:
use arrow keys to inspect candidate summaries, Space to select/unselect drafts,
and Enter to apply the selected merges. Applying a merge promotes the distilled
skill into `skills/`, archives the superseded originals under
`bundles/<project>/_distilled_archive/`, and blocklists those source slugs so the
curator does not immediately recreate them. With `--stage`, approved semantic
candidates are written to `bundles/<project>/_pending/` instead, so
`watchmen review` remains the slower approval gate.

### Model comparison for skill buckets

```bash
watchmen compare exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance
watchmen compare exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance --candidates openai/gpt-5-mini,deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash
watchmen compare exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance --tasks 3 --best-of 3
watchmen compare exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance --concurrency 6
watchmen compare exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance --candidate tencent/hy3-preview
watchmen compare exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance --candidates none --comparison-model moonshotai/kimi-k2.6
```

`compare` evaluates replacement models for one skill bucket using watchmen's
own skill evidence. For each task variant, it generates one reference output
with Opus 4.7 by default, generates best-of-N candidate outputs through
OpenRouter with bounded per-task parallelism, and asks GPT-5.5 to blindly score
every output against the bucket evidence. The report aggregates quality, wins
against the reference, total cost with retries included, provider-reported
completion tokens, visible output characters, empty and maxed sample counts,
latency, and clearer Pareto-style decisions such as `replace reference`,
`cheap tradeoff`, `invalid output`, and `dominated`.

Artifacts are written under `bundles/<project>/_compare/<run_id>/`:
`config.json`, `tasks.json`, `generations.jsonl`, `judgments.jsonl`,
`summary.json`, and `report.md`.

The built-in candidate pool includes `openai/gpt-5-mini`,
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`,
`minimax/minimax-m2.5`, `tencent/hy3-preview`, `stepfun/step-3.5-flash`, and
`moonshotai/kimi-k2.6`. Use repeatable `--candidate` / `--comparison-model`
flags to add one-off models; use `--candidates none` when you want only the
explicitly flagged models.

### Iterative skill routing with watchmen-driven improvement

```bash
watchmen route exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance
watchmen route exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance --no-improve     # one-shot mode
watchmen route exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance --max-iters 5
watchmen route exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance --threshold 0.85
watchmen route exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance --max-cost-usd 10
watchmen route exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance --cross-harness  # compare across harnesses
watchmen route exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance --no-rewrite     # report only, no file writes
watchmen route exploit-agent --bucket model-repl-compliance --commit-improvements  # keep watchmen's edits even if no cheap model converged
```

`route` answers a sharper question than `compare`. Where `compare` picks the best model out of an OpenRouter pool, `route` asks: **can a cheaper model in your actual harness carry this skill, and if not, can watchmen rewrite the skill so it can?**

The loop:

1. **Detect.** Read `corpus.db` for the most-recent model each harness ran on this project (claude-code, codex, opencode, pi.dev). That model is the reference; cheaper same-family models are the candidates.
2. **Compare.** Generate + judge per harness (`compare` engine, blind judge on stored skill evidence).
3. **Improve.** If no candidate clears `reference - 0.05` (configurable via `--threshold`), watchmen reads the judge's failure rationales (ambiguous triggers, missing steps, hallucinated procedure) and revises SKILL.md to fix those specific failure modes.
4. **Loop.** Re-sweep the (post-cull) candidate pool with the revised skill. Repeat up to `--max-iters 3`.
5. **Commit.** When a cheap model clears the threshold, route emits the harness-specific model-bearing artifact and rewrites the skill body so the user's main agent natively delegates to the cheaper model:

| harness     | artifact watchmen emits                                | dispatch syntax in SKILL.md body                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| claude-code | `<repo>/.claude/agents/<bucket>-router.md`             | Task tool with `subagent_type="<bucket>-router"`                          |
| codex       | `~/.codex/route-<bucket>.config.toml`                  | `codex exec --profile-v2 route-<bucket>`                                  |
| opencode    | `<repo>/.opencode/agents/<bucket>-router.md`           | `@<bucket>-router` mention                                                |
| pi.dev      | `~/.pi/agent/agents/<bucket>.md` (with opt-in extension) — falls back to a body-only "run `pi --model X`" recommendation otherwise | extension's Task tool             |

**Hard stop preserves your SKILL.md.** If no cheap model converges after `max_iters`, the improved skill is *not* committed unless you pass `--commit-improvements`. The improved version is always saved to `bundles/<project>/_route/<run_id>/SKILL.md.final` so you can read it and decide manually.

Decision labels: `stay` (current model wins), `downshift` (cheaper same-family model cleared threshold), `upshift` (pricier model needed; cheap floor not reachable yet), `switch-harness` (best cleared candidate is another harness's current model — only fires with `--cross-harness`). Inherits compare's quality guards (`invalid` / `unstable` / `truncated` / `dominated`) so damaged candidates never get promoted.

SKILL.md body edits live inside `<!-- watchmen-route:dispatch -->` markers so future `watchmen curate` regenerations preserve them. All file writes are audit-logged at `bundles/<project>/_route/<run_id>/skill_rewrites.jsonl`.

## vs Claude Code's `/insights`

Claude Code shipped `/insights` in v2.1.117 (Apr 2026) — LLM-narrated HTML report from your transcripts. It's good. watchmen is **complementary**:

| | `/insights` | watchmen |
|---|---|---|
| **Output** | One-shot HTML report | Git-tracked skill bundles + CLAUDE.md |
| **Adapters** | Claude Code only | Claude Code + Codex + pi.dev |
| **Scope** | Global, flat aggregate | Per-project bundles + cross-repo digest |
| **Cadence** | On-demand, manual | Continuous via daemon |
| **Provenance** | No traceable source | `watchmen why <skill>` → source sessions with adapter tags |
| **Privacy** | LLM call on full corpus | Local storage; selected excerpts sent to your chosen LLM provider (OpenRouter / OpenAI / Anthropic) for analysis |

Both are useful. Run both.

watchmen show                    List every curated project + skill count
watchmen show <key>              List a project's artifacts
watchmen show <key> <skill>      Dump a single SKILL.md
watchmen why <key> <skill>       Provenance: source sessions with adapter tags
watchmen recent [<key>]          Git log of curator runs
watchmen insights                Cross-repo digest — pairs with Anthropic's /insights
watchmen open [<key>]            Open viewer in browser (jumps to project page)
watchmen logs [daemon|viewer]    Tail scheduler logs (-f to follow)

# Control
watchmen pin <key> <skill>       Freeze a skill — next curator run skips it
watchmen unpin <key> <skill>     Remove from pin list
watchmen drop <key> <skill>      Remove bundle + blocklist the slug
watchmen restore <key> <skill>   Allow a blocked slug to be re-proposed
watchmen learn <key>             Fast cycle: analyze + CLAUDE.md refresh (~$0.50)
watchmen learn <key> --full      With full curator (Stage 1+2+3)
watchmen review <key>            Interactive walk: pending then approved
watchmen distill <key>           Skill mesh + merge plan for context rot
watchmen distill <key> --stage   Stage merged drafts in _pending/
watchmen compare <key> --bucket <skill>    Compare models on one skill bucket
watchmen route <key> --bucket <skill>      Pick the best model each harness can use; rewrite skill for native delegation

## Cost & privacy

**Cost.** Per project, a full curator run (analyst + 6-8 skill bundles + CLAUDE.md) is `$3-8` in deepseek-v4-flash. Incremental daemon cycles are `$0.10-0.50` since they only process new days. `watchmen insights` cross-repo digest: ~$0.05-0.10 per regeneration.

**Privacy.** Runtime state lives locally. Your session transcripts already live
in `~/.claude/projects/` / `~/.codex/sessions/` — Anthropic and OpenAI put them
there. watchmen reads them, builds a SQLite corpus on your disk, and sends only
the chunks needed for analysis to your chosen LLM provider (OpenRouter, OpenAI, or Anthropic) during
analyst, curator, and insights runs. The artifacts it generates (`bundles/`,
`analyses/`) stay on your disk.

If you don't want certain repos analyzed, just don't track them — auto-detect only suggests, `watchmen track` is opt-in.

## Adapter roadmap

| Source | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code **CLI** | ✅ shipped | Hooks + transcript ingest both work |
| Claude Code **desktop** (Mac/Windows) | ✅ shipped | Same `~/.claude/projects/` + `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| **Codex** (CLI / desktop) | ✅ shipped | `cd` adapter — `~/.codex/sessions/` |
| **pi.dev** (CLI) | ✅ shipped | `pi` adapter — pi.dev's session export |
| **Cursor** | 🤔 considering | SQLite sessions, **no hooks** — post-session polling only |
| **OpenCode** | 🤔 considering | Clean `opencode export` CLI; straightforward adapter |
| **Codex Cloud / Claude.ai web** | ❌ out of scope | No local files, no hooks |

## Limitations + caveats

- **Hook server must run in a separate terminal.** It's a Python+FastAPI process; killing the terminal stops hook capture. Run via `tmux`/`screen`, a launchd job, a systemd `--user` unit, a Task Scheduler task, or `watchmen daemon install`.
- **Some skill curators occasionally run long (20+ min)** without calling the `finish_skill` terminal tool. Bundle still lands on disk; just no clean signal. ~15-20% hit this.
- **Project-key auto-detection is heuristic.** Some path-encoded names (e.g., `my-business/marketing` vs `my-business-marketing`) can resolve ambiguously. Use `watchmen track <key> --repo <abs-path>` to be explicit.
